# VB6Enjoyer's 30 Days of JavaScript solutions

This repo has all of my solutions to the <a href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript">30 Days of JavaScript Challenge</a> by Asabeneh Yetayeh. The code in this repo goes from simplistic logic to building simple web apps on static sites, entirely through JavaScript. These are the contents for each day (skipping day 20, which has no exercises):

<ol>
  <li>Comments, data types, and variables exercises</li>
  <li>Data types, Strings, and Numbers exercises</li>
  <li>Exercises for Booleans, Null, Undefined, operators, window methods and the Date object</li>
  <li>Conditionals (If-Else, Switch-Case, Ternary operators) exercises</li>
  <li>Arrays exercises</li>
  <li>Loops (for, while, do while, for of) exercises</li>
  <li>Functions exercises</li>
  <li>Scope and objects exercises</li>
  <li>Callbacks, intervals, timeouts and functional programming exercises</li>
  <li>Sets and Maps exercises</li>
  <li>Destructuring and spreading exercises</li>
  <li>RegEx exercises</li>
  <li>Console methods exercises</li>
  <li>Error handling exercises</li>
  <li>Classes and inheritance exercises</li>
  <li>JSON methods exercises</li>
  <li>HTML5 web storage exercises</li>
  <li>Promise and asynchronous functions exercises</li>
  <li>Closure exercises</li>
  <li>DOM manipulation exercises and simple page with changing colors and datetime in real time</li>
  <li>Number generator (0-100) with conditional styling, list of countries, and challenges portfolio page with changing colors and datetime in real time</li>
  <li>Dynamic number generator web app with conditional styling, and keyboard code event listener web app</li>
  <li>Planet object weight calculator web app</li>
  <li>World countries population/languages graphs visualization web app</li>
  <li>World countries list web app with filtering and sorting</li>
  <li>Simple portfolio website with dynamic styling</li>
  <li>Leaderboard web app</li>
  <li>Simple animation using dynamic styling through JS</li>
  <li>World countries data and population/languages stats visualization web app with filtering and conditional sorting, and form validator using RegEx</li>
</ol>

The exercises from day 21 onwards are generally interesting and can take a few hours to make, especially if you have attention to detail like me. Some require a bit of slightly complex logic. Since the challenge doesn't include any reference files for the apps that I had to build, all of them were built using images and gifs provided in the challenge as reference, so there are some liberties taken.
